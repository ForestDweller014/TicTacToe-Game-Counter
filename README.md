# TicTacToe-Game-Counter
Counts the number of valid possible Tic Tac Toe games that end in a tie, win or loss. It is a recursive backtracking solution. If the starting piece being different counts
as a different game state, just multiply the result by two.

The board is represented by a two-dimensional array in which 0 represents an empty space, 1 represents the "O" piece, and 2 represents the "X" piece.
